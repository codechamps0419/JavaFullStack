Lambda Expressions :
=====================

Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface.
It provides a clear and concise way to represent functional interface using an expression.
It is very useful in collection library. It helps to iterate, filter and 
extract data from collection. It can be treated as any other java object.

Lambda expression in java is an anonymous (no name) function that 
does not need to define the data type of input parameters and does not need to have a return type.

Syntax:
----------
(args) 			-> 			 {}
{arguments} {Arrow-token}  {body}
